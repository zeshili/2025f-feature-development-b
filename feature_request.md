# Feature: Temperature Unit Toggle (°C / °F)

## Description
Participants will add a temperature unit toggle that lets users switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit within the weather app. The feature should update all displayed temperatures when toggled and visually indicate the selected unit. The preference should persist across sessions so that the app remembers the user’s last choice.

## Expected Outcome
A working toggle button or switch that changes all temperature values in the app and stores the user’s preferred unit for later sessions.

## Notes for Participants
You may choose how to style or position the toggle (e.g., header switch, dropdown, or button group) as long as it clearly switches between °C and °F and updates the displayed values.
